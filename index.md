#### Code Review

Code review is a systematic process where developers check each other’s code for errors, quality, and project standards before merging. It catches bugs, encourages collaboration, and ensures best practices, focusing on functionality, design, security, and coding style to make software reliable and maintainable.

#### Project 1: Software Engineering and Design

The first artifact of this portfolio is a Hair Salon website where customers can fill out a form with their chosen services and see what their total cost will be for their appointment. The entire website is built from backend to frontend by me and is a great example of my full stack capabilities.
