## Final Computer Science Capstone Project

Welcome to my final computer science capstone project. The following pages include the three artifacts that I have chosen to properly update and design to meet specific course outcomes in order to complete this project successfully. This page begins with a code review of the three artifacts that I have chosen with planned modifications that will be performed to meet the course outcomes. A brief overview of the projects selected with links to each project's readme and associated files. The last section is a professional self-assessment that reflects on my time here at SNHU and how I will apply these skills to my professional career as I move forward with this degree.  

### Code Review

Code review is a systematic process where developers check each other’s code for errors, quality, and project standards before merging. It catches bugs, encourages collaboration, and ensures best practices, focusing on functionality, design, security, and coding style to make software reliable and maintainable.

### Project 1: Software Engineering and Design

The first artifact of this portfolio is a Hair Salon website where customers can fill out a form with their chosen services and see what their total cost will be for their appointment. The entire website is built from backend to frontend by me and is a great example of my full stack capabilities.

## Professional Self-Assessment

As I approach the completion of my studies in the Computer Science program at Southern New Hampshire University (SNHU), I find it valuable to reflect on my academic journey and evaluate how my experiences have prepared me to continue my career as a software developer. 

The curriculum at SNHU offered a comprehensive foundation in computer science principles, programming languages, and software engineering methodologies. Throughout the program, I gained proficiency in languages such as Python, Java, and C++, which are essential tools in the software development industry. Courses in algorithms, data structures, and database management systems challenged me to think critically and solve complex problems efficiently. Collaborative projects and hands-on assignments allowed me to apply theoretical concepts to real-world scenarios. Participating in team-based software development projects improved my communication skills and taught me the value of effective collaboration, version control, and agile practices. These experiences mirror the dynamics of professional development environments and have equipped me with the technical and interpersonal skills necessary for success.

My primary career goal is to advance as a software developer, building innovative solutions and contributing to impactful projects. The coursework and extracurricular opportunities at SNHU have directly supported this ambition. By working on this capstone project and internships, I have had the chance to design, develop, and deploy software applications, which closely aligns with the responsibilities I aim to take on as I move forward in my career. Additionally, SNHU emphasized the importance of lifelong learning and adaptability in technology. I have developed a growth mindset, staying current with emerging technologies and best practices. This attitude is crucial in a field where rapid change is the norm, and it will continue to guide my professional development as I pursue new challenges and opportunities.



<code> Course Outcome 1: </code> I Employed strategies for building collaborative environments that enable diverse audiences to support organizational decision-making in the field of computer science by completing the code review before beginning my enhancements. Code review plays a critical role in the successful delivery of software projects by enabling developers to identify areas for improvement through comprehensive analysis. This process supports effective organizational decision-making. A similar benefit can be observed in Project 3: Databases, which involved developing a front-end database with Python and SQLite. This project fosters collaboration by allowing users—including those without programming expertise—to easily input data, contributing to a more inclusive and efficient working environment.

<code> Course Outcome 2: </code> I Designed, Developed, and Delivered professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts by completing Project 1: Software Engineering and Design. This project is grounded in a professionally developed front-end design, tailored specifically for business use. Both the visual elements and written content adhere to high standards of professionalism, resulting in a cohesive and technically robust website. Additionally, the backend infrastructure complements the front-end seamlessly, reflecting my comprehensive expertise in full stack development.
