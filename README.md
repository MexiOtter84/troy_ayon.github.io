For <code>Enhancement One: Software Design and Engineering</code>, I have taken a program that I built with Python from my CS-200 course and converted it into a website fully developing the front and back end systems for it with skills that I learned from CS-465. The website is a mockup that I plan to design soon for my significant other’s professional hair salon business where customers can select services and get a cost estimate for booking.

The original project was built in Python and produced a terminal window with information based on selections made by the user. The functionality of the terminal window is not optimal for today’s customers who would like to book and utilize services for a hair salon. Customers would need a front-end facing option to be able to book services and the best way to accomplish this would be a user-friendly web interface. I then created a basic website design utilizing HTML and CSS, while also creating a form in HTML that works with JavaScript in the backend to change elements within the HTML code while it performs basic arithmetic to complete the addition of services selected for the user. 

Going through the expected course outcomes, I was able to meet two of them specifically with this artifact’s enhancement features applied which include:

<code>Outcome 2 – Design, develop and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent, technically sound, and appropriately adapted to specific audiences and contexts.</code>

<code>Outcome 4 – Demonstrate an ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices for the purpose of implementing computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals.</code>

I met these outcomes with this artifact by being able to fully develop and create a functional website that heavily relies on front-end professional design that meets customer requirements. The design of the website and services calculator are visually coherent for the customer, and the backend works to supply the pricing information for services selected. Innovations of this artifact that were added include a responsive website and form where the form can know if a user fills out all required fields which include first name, last name, phone number and any preferences or notes for the stylist. If a customer refuses to enter these necessary fields that allow the stylist to perform quality services, there is a red box that will notify the customer on the required fields to fill out prior to being able to submit their request.

I also took into cosideration notes from my professor on the first iteration and also updated the program by setting up a backend service to manage the site where server-side processing is performed as well as persistent data storage and secure communication between client and server. Security measures that were added since the original iteration included a server-side validation system which was implemented, SQL injection protection via parameterized queries and CORS was enabled and configured for production environments. Additionally, I created an Admin portal page that employees of the salon would have access to after creating an account and are able to view all bookings within their systems as well as the ability to edit and delete them. 

After going through and updating and modifying Artifact 1, I was able to continue building on my foundational skills of full-stack development as well as continue to work with Python as it is one of the primary languages used in a lot of the data engineering backend fields that I plan to further explore. When I was first designing this website, I ran into some challenges on how to include the original calculator that was created in CS-200 and updating that for consumption with my website and form. After going through some additional resources, I was able to review how to properly set up my program to work with the form and eventually was able to combine them to create a fully functional website and form.

### <pre align="center"> Future Updates </pre>
For future updates, I also plan to use this as a base for a website idea I have to put into production and with it I will also include additional tools and services such as an email system that notifies users about their upcoming appointments and confirm them within the system. This also brings the need for a confirmation system and possibly a mobile application that users are able to utilize as well that links them direclty to their stylists. Being more personalized, the website could also use some details about each stylist working there once it is in production and each stylist can have a biography with a professional gallary of what they can do.
